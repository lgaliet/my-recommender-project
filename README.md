# AIMovieRecommender
TODO:
- call api in the frontend
- need to format movie titles how they are in the movies.csv
- if there are movies from frontend that are in the backend movies then make recommendations based on those movies
- otherwise just make recommendations based on main genre of the movie

- default screen -> has favorites, recommendations based on favorites, and just lists movies based on genres
- search screen -> just displays favorites and movies that are searched for
