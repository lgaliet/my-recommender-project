# AIMovieRecommender
TODO:
- make api so frontend can access recommender methods
- utilize the methods in the frontend
- if there are movies from frontend that are in the backend movies then make recommendations based on those movies
- otherwise just make recommendations based on main genre of the movie

- other categories
- default screen -> has favorites, recommendations based on favorites, and just lists movies based on genres
- search screen -> just displays favorites and movies that are searched for
